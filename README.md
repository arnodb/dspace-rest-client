[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/idmgroup/dspace-rest-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/idmgroup/dspace-rest-client) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/idmgroup/dspace-rest-client/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/idmgroup/dspace-rest-client?branch=master)

Java REST Client for DSpace

## Description

There are two clients:

* one that is fully generated by the Jersey [wadl2java](https://wadl.java.net/wadl2java.html) tool
(except the wrapper that deals with the authentication token): DSpaceJerseyRestClient
* one that is Spring based and is generated by a custom script from the WADL file: DSpaceRestClient

The first has the advantage to be fully generated in a standard way. The second has the advantage to be concise.

Both are dealing with the authentication token automatically.

## Spring dependency

The Spring dependency is set to Spring 4.2 but the code has been successfuly tested with Spring 3.2.

## Versioning

The versioning of the client reflects the versioning of the DSpace repository. The current master
branch supports version 5_x of the API. On the short term a dspace-5_x branch will be created for
the 5_x support and master will be dedicated to DSpace master, i.e. 6_x. The version number contains
a additional maintenance number.

## Build hints

### Update WADL

```
$ ./scripts/get-wadl.sh
```


### Regenerate DSpaceRestClient.java

```
$ ./scripts/wadl2java.pl \
    src/main/resources/org/dspace/demo/rest/application.wadl \
    scripts/DSpaceRestClient.java.tt \
    >| src/main/java/com/idmgroup/dspace/rest/DSpaceRestClient.java
```

## TODO

* create a 5_x branch (current code is based on DSpace 5.3 REST API)
* update master to be compatible with DSpace 6.0-SNAPSHOT
* fix the spotted DSpace issue and request a pull (addCollectionItem seems not to save the item name)
